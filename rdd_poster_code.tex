   The Effect of the Universal Child Care Cash Benefit on Female Labour Supply in Spain:
   The article investigates the impact of Spain's universal child care cash benefit, known as the "baby bonus," on female labor supply. This policy, which offered a 2700 dollar subsidy per child born to increase the birth rate, is analyzed through a quasi-experiment using the Difference-in-Differences (DiD) method. Findings suggest the subsidy had a positive effect on increasing female labor participation by reducing child-related costs.

    \Large % Larger main text
    Uses a regression discontinuity design to analyze the sharp cutoff established for benefit eligibility, comparing outcomes between treated and control families arbitrarily close to the cutoff to determine the treatment effect.

    \Large % Larger main text
   The introduction of the child benefit led to a noticeable increase in the number of conceptions and a corresponding decrease in the incidence of abortions. This suggests that the policy was successful in encouraging new conceptions, resulting in a significant, estimated 6 percent increase in the annual number of births.
